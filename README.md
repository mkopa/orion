 **Orion** is a high-performance, lightweight, embedded vector database engine written in modern C++20. It was conceived to address a growing need in the AI landscape: the ability to perform complex, low-latency vector operations directly within an application, without the overhead and dependencies of a client-server architecture.

Traditional vector databases excel at managing massive, distributed indexes in the cloud. Orion, however, is engineered for a different paradigm, bringing the power of large-scale similarity search to the edge. By operating as a linkable library, it eliminates network latency, ensures data privacy, and enables applications to function entirely offline. This makes Orion the ideal solution for on-device AI, edge computing, and any system where data locality, speed, and reliability are paramount.

At its core, Orion's performance is built upon two key algorithmic foundations:
HNSW for Similarity Search: For its Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search capabilities, Orion implements the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm. Instead of performing a brute-force search with linear complexity O(N), HNSW constructs a multi-layered graph of interconnected data points. Queries traverse this graph from a sparse top layer (analogous to a highway system) to progressively denser lower layers (local roads), achieving a near-logarithmic complexity of O(log N). This allows for querying millions of vectors in milliseconds, providing an exceptional balance between search speed and accuracy.

Inverted Index for Metadata Filtering: Recognizing that vector similarity is often just one dimension of a query, Orion integrates a robust metadata filtering system. This is powered by a classic Inverted Index, a data structure that maps metadata key-value pairs to the set of vector IDs possessing them. When a query includes a filter (e.g., "find vectors similar to X where category = 'A' and active = true"), Orion first performs a rapid set intersection operation on the inverted index to produce a small candidate set of allowed vector IDs. Only then is the computationally intensive HNSW search performed on this pre-filtered set. This two-phase approach dramatically prunes the search space, enabling complex, multi-faceted queries to execute with minimal performance impact.

With C++20, Orion leverages modern language features for memory safety and a clean, expressive API, delivering a tool that is not only powerful but also a pleasure to integrate and use.

 ### Core Philosophy & Key Features
 
 Orion is built on a set of core principles that differentiate it from large, server-based vector databases.
 
 *   **üöÄ Truly Embedded:** Orion is a library, not a server. Link it directly to your application for zero-latency data access. There are no network calls, no REST APIs, just pure function calls.
 
 *   **‚ö° High-Performance ANN Search:** At its core, Orion uses a highly optimized implementation of HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World), one of the fastest and most accurate algorithms for Approximate Nearest Neighbor search.
 
 *   **üóÇÔ∏è Rich Metadata Filtering:** Don't just search by similarity. Orion features a powerful pre-filtering mechanism that allows you to narrow down your search space based on metadata *before* the vector search occurs, leading to highly relevant and efficient queries.
 
 *   **üì¶ Single-File Database:** The entire database, including vectors, HNSW index, and metadata indexes, is stored in a single, portable file, making backups and data management trivial.
 
 *   **üõ°Ô∏è Modern C++ Design:** Built with C++20, Orion leverages modern language features for performance, safety, and a clean, expressive API. The design uses idioms like Pimpl to ensure a stable and clean public interface.
 
 *   **üíæ Atomic & Crash-Safe Saves:** Explicit `save()` operations ensure that the database file is written atomically, protecting against data corruption in case of an application crash.
 
 ### When to use Orion
 
 Orion excels in scenarios where data locality and low latency are critical.
 
 **Ideal use cases:**
 *   **On-device AI:** Mobile or desktop apps that need to perform similarity search on local data (e.g., photo matching, semantic search in notes).
 *   **IoT & Edge Computing:** Devices that need to analyze sensor data or images locally without relying on a cloud connection.
 *   **Application-Specific Backends:** Services that require a fast, local cache or index for a subset of data (e.g., recommendation engines for a user's immediate context).
 
 **When *not* to use Orion:**
 *   As a replacement for petabyte-scale, distributed, cloud-native vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate. Orion is designed for a single-node, embedded context.

 ### Quick Start
 
 Here is a minimal example demonstrating the full lifecycle of creating, populating, saving, loading, and querying an Orion database.
 
 ```cpp
 #include <iostream>
 #include <vector>
 #include <cstdio>
 #include "orion/database.h"
 
 int main() {
     const std::string db_path = "my_app_db.orion";
     
     // 1. Create a new database
     {
         orion::Config config;
         config.vector_dim = 2; // Our vectors will have 2 dimensions
         auto db_optional = orion::Database::create(db_path, config);
         if (!db_optional) {
             return 1; // Failed to create
         }
         auto db = std::move(*db_optional);
 
         // 2. Add data with metadata
         db.add(1, {1.0f, 2.0f}, {{"category", "A"}, {"active", (int64_t)1}});
         db.add(2, {1.1f, 2.1f}, {{"category", "A"}, {"active", (int64_t)0}});
         db.add(3, {5.0f, 6.0f}, {{"category", "B"}, {"active", (int64_t)1}});
 
         // 3. Save the database to disk
         db.save();
     }
 
     // 4. Load the database from disk
     {
         auto db_optional = orion::Database::load(db_path);
         if (!db_optional) {
             return 1; // Failed to load
         }
         auto db = std::move(*db_optional);
 
         // 5. Perform a filtered query
         // "Find the vector closest to {5.2, 6.2} that has category 'B' and is active"
         orion::Vector query_vec = {5.2f, 6.2f};
         orion::Metadata filter = {{"category", "B"}, {"active", (int64_t)1}};
         
         auto results = db.query(query_vec, 1, filter);
 
         // 6. Print results (should find ID 3)
         for (const auto& res : results) {
             std::cout << "Found ID: " << res.id 
                       << ", Distance: " << res.distance << std::endl;
         }
     }
     
     std::remove(db_path.c_str());
     return 0;
 }
 ```
